PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In our project we are tracking object with the help of webcam in real time by using cam shift algorithm, 
it uses hue based object tracking. we are building this project on python and using openCV and Numpy libraries. 
You can use the program to control the arrows key and mouse.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Track the movement of an object by using webcam. 
Device a method to detect the object accurately. 

TECHNOLOGY USED
1.python
2.openCV 
3.Numpy
4.Camshift Algorithm
